**I'd like everything at /forum, how can I do that?**
Easily! The listing pages are views so you can change the paths on the page displays, and as for Categories and Threads you can change the URL alias patterns at: Configuration > Search and metadata > URL aliases > Patterns. This page and functionality is provided by the pathauto module which harmony_core requires.
